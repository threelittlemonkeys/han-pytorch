This movie is very good.
The screenplay is enchanting.
But Meryl Streep is most impressive.
Her performance is excellent.
She brings me to go into the heart of her role.
positive

This movie will always be a Broadway and Movie classic, as long as there are still people who sing, dance, and act.
positive

This film made John Glover a star.
Alan Raimy is one of the most compelling character that I have ever seen on film.
And I mean that sport.
positive

Did Sandra (yes, she must have) know we would still be here for her some nine years later?
See it if you haven't, again if you have; see her live while you can.
positive

My favorite movie.
What a great story this really was.
I'd just like to be able to buy a copy of it but this does not seem possible.
positive

GREAT movie and the family will love it!!
If kids are bored one day just pop the tape in and you'll be so glad you did!!!

i luv raven-s!
positive

Brilliant kung-fu scenes, loads of melodrama, peculiar footwear symbolism and an unhappy (?) end makes Barefoot Kid an unforgettable film.
One of the silliest subtitles I've seen...
positive

This Schiffer guy is a real genius!
The movie is of excellent quality and both entertaining and educating.
I didn't know what a weather girl was before I learned it here.
positive

I think it's one of the greatest movies which are ever made, and I've seen many...
The book is better, but it's still a very good movie!
positive

If there is a movie to be called perfect then this is it.
So bad it wasn't intended to be that way.
But superb anyway...
Go find it somewhere.
Whatever you do...
Do not miss it!!!
positive

As usual, Sean Connery does a great job.
Lawrence Fishburn is good, but I have a hard time not seeing him as Ike Turner.
positive

I just saw the movie on tv.
I really enjoyed it.
I like a good mystery.
and this one had me guessing up to the end.
Sean Connery did a good job.
I would recomend it to a friend.
positive

Brilliant execution in displaying once and for all, this time in the venue of politics, of how "good intentions do actually pave the road to hell".
Excellent!
positive

Kept my attention from start to finish.
Great performances added to this tremendous film.
Mr. Pacino once again gives us another brilliant character to enjoy.
positive

One of my favorite scenes is at the beginning when guests on a private yacht decide to take an impromptu swim - in their underwear!
Rather risqué for 1931!
positive

Much underrated camp movie on the level of Cobra Woman, etc.
Photographic stills resemble Rembrandt prints.
Sometimes subtle dialog and hidden literate touches found throughout.
positive

This unpretentious Horror film is probably destined to become a cult classic.
Much much better than 90% of the Scream rip-offs out there!
I even hope they come up with a sequel!
positive

with very little screen time and money, Dan Katzir manages to do so much.
This movie, in its heart-warming simplicity, touches the beauty of love from a fresh angle.
rejuvinated lust
positive

Touching; Well directed autobiography of a talented young director/producer.
A love story with Rabin's assassination in the background.
Worth seeing !
positive

Although not one of Vonnegut's better known works, it is a definite "must-see".
Interestingly thought out, I especially like how the director filmed the couple in love.
positive

This is the definitive movie version of Hamlet.
Branagh cuts nothing, but there are no wasted moments.
positive

This is actually one of my favorite films, I would recommend that EVERYONE watches it.
There is some great acting in it and it shows that not all "good" films are American....
positive

I liked the movie a real lot.
Wanted to see it just for Dara Tomanovich, but the plot and story were ok too.
A very cool change in plot when you least expect it.
positive

I don't know why I like this movie so well, but I never get tired of watching it.
positive

Love it, love it, love it!
This is another absolutely superb performance from the Divine Miss M.
From the beginning to the end, this is one big treat!
Don't rent it- buy it now!
positive

Drum scene is wild!
Cook, Jr. is unsung hero of this and many movies.
Fantastic actor, great flick.
A few twists that keep you moving.
A must-see.
positive

It is an almost ideal romantic anime!
MUST SEE FOR ALL AGES!
But the English dubbed version is not too good.
Perhaps the 1999 version will be better.
positive

Obviously written for the stage.
Lightweight but worthwhile.
How can you go wrong with Ralph Richardson, Olivier and Merle Oberon.
positive

Go, Igor, go, you are the proof that Slovenian films may, should and must be different.
There's soul in it, and this is rare.
Don't let anybody put you down!
positive

I was overtaken by the emotion.
Unforgettable rendering of a wartime story which is unknown to most people.
The performances were faultless and outstanding.
positive

I watched this film over a hundred times.
It is really best Serbian movie made ever.
I wood like to recommend this movie to everyone.
It is very good comedy.
I surely like it!!!!
positive

Adrian Pasdar is excellent is this film.
He makes a fascinating woman.
positive

This film is one of Michael Keaton's best.
Throughout the film he is 'on'.
With co-stars like Ms. Henner, Joe Piscopo and Danny DeVito, you can't go wrong.
Great laughs, great fun for everyone.
positive

THis movie shows us once again, how genius the Japanese directors are and were.
This movie could be seen as a sort of a "Silent - Movie Tetsuo".
Well Eisenstein...:)
positive

I´m from Germany and I love the mvovies.
I go 200 times a year.
Tonight I saw "Pecker", it was a wonderful evening.
Thank you, Mr. Waters.
Everybody who has a chance to see the movie, go!!!
positive

The movie was a big Car Commercial. :-)
But who cares?
I went to the theater to view the Shelby Cobra, Angelina & Cage.
So I guess it was a good movie. *bg*
positive

Allison Dean's performance is what stands out in my mind watching this film.
She balances out the melancholy tone of the film with an iridescent energy.
I would like to see more of her.
positive

Brilliant movie.
The drawings were just amazing.
Too bad it ended before it begun.
I´ve waited 21 years for a sequel, but nooooo!!!
positive

The one of the most remarkable sci-fi movies of the millennium.
Not only a movie but an incredible future vision, this movie establishes a new standard of s/f movies.
hail and kill!
positive

The only thing serious about this movie is the humor.
Well worth the rental price.
I'll bet you watch it twice.
It's obvious that Sutherland enjoyed his role.
positive

Excellent episode movie ala Pulp Fiction.
7 days - 7 suicides.
It doesnt get more depressing than this.
Movie rating: 8/10 Music rating: 10/10
positive

To quote Flik, that was my reaction exactly:
Wow...you're perfect!
This is the best movie!
I think I can even say it's become my favorite movie ever, even.
Wow.
I tell you what, wow.
positive

I thought this was a quiet good movie.
It was fun to watch it.
What I liked best where the 'Outtakes' at the end of the movie.
They were GREAT.
positive

If you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie.
If you are young or old then you will love this movie, hell even my mom liked it.
Great Camp!!!
positive

And I really mean that.
I caught it last night on Vh1, and I was not expecting it to be so good.
This is now one of my favorites.
I must add that it has a killer soundtrack.
positive

This is a great film.
Touching and strong.
The direction is without question breathless.
Good work to the team.
I feel so sorry for Marlene, By the grace of God go you or I
positive

This is a 'sleeper'.
It defines Nicholas Cage.
The plot is intricate and totally absorbing.
The ending will blow you away.
See it whenever you have the opportunity.
positive

I agree with the other comments.
I saw this movie years ago.
Christopher Plummer is hilarious as a dandy.
The ribaldry is unsurpassed.
If this comes out on video, I will definitely buy it.
positive

Love it, love it, love it!
This is another absolutely superb performance from the Divine Miss M. From the beginning to the end, this is one big treat!
Don't rent it- buy it now!
positive

A nicely done thriller with plenty of sex in it.
I saw it on late night TV.
There are two hardcore stars in it, Lauen Montgomery and Venus.
Thankfully, Gabriella Hall has just a small part.
positive

The characters are unlikeable and the script is awful.
It's a waste of the talents of Deneuve and Auteuil.
negative

This piece ain't really worth a comment..
It's simply the worst "horror" movie i have ever seen.
The actors are bad as bad can be and the whole plot is so silly it nearly made me cry.
Shame on you I say!!
negative

Giant crabs cursing in Japanese? What was in that drink? A terrible movie, but laughable.
I love the invisible Samurai ghosties running around.
Drink much beer before you see this movie.
negative

This movie is terrible but it has some good effects.
negative

Malcolm McDowell has not had too many good movies lately and this is no different.
Especially designed for people who like Yellow filters on their movies.
negative

This movie was absolutely terrible.
I can't believe I paid to see it in the theatre.
I wouldn't watch it on free cable t.v.
I'm surprised that Joe Magtena even made it.
Do not waste your time with this movie.
negative

This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen.
It is not funny.
It is not interesting and should not have been made.
negative

Ming The Merciless does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul!
negative

Were I not with friends, and so cheap, I would have walked out.
It failed miserably as satire and didn't even have the redemption of camp.
negative

I think that movie can`t be a Scott`s film.
That is impossible.
Do you remember Blade Runner? And Alien? Two greats movies versus a one.
I hope didn´t see ever it.
good bye!!
negative

If you haven't seen this, it's terrible.
It is pure trash.
I saw this about 17 years ago, and I'm still screwed up from it.
negative

Not good! Rent or buy the original! Watch this only if someone has a gun to your head and then....maybe.
It is like claiming an Elvis actor is as good as the real King.
negative

Apart from Helen Bonham Carter, there is nothing worthy about this movie....
And the surprise ending?! The thought of a sequel is even more annoying.
Save your money, wait for the video and ignore that too.
negative

The only remarkable fact is the participation of Klaus Kinski who plays a priest.
Don't ask me why he does it! A bad, bad movie overall.
negative

Well, not yet, at least.
It's not listed in the worst 100...
So let's all team up, and put it in it's rightful place.
This is truly a bad movie. (And I liked Ishtar!) ;)
negative

Comment this movie is impossible.
Is terrible, very improbable, bad interpretation e direction.
Not look!!!!!
negative

Please avoid this movie at all costs.
This is without a doubt, the worst movie I've ever seen.
Most movies have at least one redeeming value.
This has none.
Totally horrible!
negative

I wouldn't rent this one even on dollar rental night.
negative

This movie stinks.
The stench resembles bad cowpies that sat in the sun too long.
I can't believe that so many talented actors wasted their time making such a hopelessly awful film.
Whew!
negative

Despite its interesting premise, 'Sniper' is quite tedious.
With a tighter script and sharper directing it could have been electrifying; instead it plods along with little tension.
negative

photography was too jumpy to follow.
dark scenes hard to see.
Had good story line too bad it got lost somewhere.
Too noisy for what was really happening Bottom line is it's a baddddd movie
negative

You'd better choose Paul Verhoeven's even if you have watched it.
negative

Unwatchable.
You can't even make it past the first three minutes.
And this is coming from a huge Adam Sandler fan!!1
negative

Great movie - especially the music - Etta James - "At Last".
This speaks volumes when you have finally found that special someone.
negative

The script for this movie was probably found in a hair-ball recently coughed up by a really old dog.
Mostly an amateur film with lame FX.
For you Zeta-Jones fanatics: she has the credibility of one Mr. Binks.
negative

this movie is the worst ive seen..
nicole kidman really dissapointed me..
this movie has nothing.
i would not watch it again even if it were the last movie on earth.
great actors but bad script.
negative

This movie is so bad, I knew how it ends right after this little girl killed the first person.
Very bad acting very bad plot very bad movie
do yourself a favour and DON'T watch it 1/10
negative

This is absolutely the worst trash I have ever seen.
When I saw it in the theater (arghhh!), it took 15 full minutes before I realized that what I was seeing was the feature, not a sick joke!
negative

I love all his work but this looks like nothing..
sorry..
This looks more like a "David Lynch copycat".
I think people like it only because "it's from David Lynch".
negative

I regret that I've seen this movie.
Can't believe that the creator of Best Intentions and Pelle the Conqueror could make such a bleak and boring film.
What a waste!
negative

Cool idea...
botched writing, botched directing, botched editing, botched acting.
Sorta makes me wish I could play God and strike everyone involved in making this film with several bolts of lightning.
negative

This is the weakest of the series, not much of a plot and a rather odd-looking Wallace.
But it's still pretty good, considering.
A sign of greater things to come!
6/10
negative

Cheap, amateurish, unimaginative, exploitative...
but don't think it'll have redeeming amusement value.
About as unentertaining, uninstructive and just plain dull as a film can be.
negative

This was an incredibly stupid movie.
It was possibly the worst movie I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through.
I cannot fathom how it ranks a rating of 5 or 6.............
negative

Bad movie.
It´s too complicated for young children and too childish for grown-ups.
I just saw it because I´m a Robin Williams fan and I was very disappointed.(
negative

This movie was lame, lame, lame.
What a build up! What a let down.
All form, no substance.
A terrible waste of talent and time.
Would not recommend it to my husband's dog, who will watch anything.
negative

A rating of "1" does not begin to express how dull, depressing and relentlessly bad this movie is.
negative

Without question, the worst ELVIS film ever made.
The movie portrays all Indians as drunk, stupid, and lazy.
Watch ELVIS's skin change color throughout the film.
negative

First one was much better, I had enjoyed it a lot.
This one has not even produced a smile.
The idea was showing how deep down can human kind fall, but in reference to the characters not the film-maker.
negative

So so special effects get in the way of recapturing the interesting relationship between Uncle Martin and Tim O'Hara that we remember from the TV series.
And what was with the suit? Annoying!
negative

My ten-year old liked it.
For me it was hard to get through it.
Christopher Lloyd played it way over the top and the suit was tedious and unfunny.
Sorry to see Jeff Daniels in this.
negative

Dreadful acting.
A thinly veiled attempt to slam those on the left side of the aisle.
Women are subjugated and revolve around men.
Tom Selleck shows his acting range from A to B.
negative

no comment - stupid movie, acting average or worse...
screenplay - no sense at all...
SKIP IT!
negative

A movie best summed up by the scene where a victim simulates disembowelment by pulling some poor animal's intestines out from under her T-shirt.
Too terrible for words.
negative

I can't believe they got the actors and actresses of that caliber to do this movie.
That's all I've got to say - the movie speaks for itself!!
negative

Oh, man! This thing scared the heck out of me when I first watched it...
and I was SIXTEEN!!!
That creepy animated Barbie is scary as hell! I want to stop talking about her now.
negative

Long, boring, blasphemous.
Never have I been so glad to see ending credits roll.
negative

The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu (1980).
This is hands down the worst film I've ever seen.
What a sad way for a great comedian to go out.
negative

An unfunny, unworthy picture which is an undeserving end to Peter Sellers' career.
It is a pity this movie was ever made.
negative

Predictable plot.
Simple dialogue.
Shockingly unemotional performances.
But Robert Downey, Jr. is so cute, I gave this "poor man's afternoon special" a 3 instead of the 1 or 2 it so richly deserved.
negative
